# Kubernetes Security Journey for DevSecOps Engineers

As DevSecOps engineers, one of the primary resposibilities is to maintain security of your Kubernetes clusters and the containers.
Here are some of the mandatory things to consider.

## Secure your API server
The Kubernetes API server is a critical component of the cluster and should be secured with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. 
Use TLS certificates for all communications with the API server.

## RBAC
Use Role-Based Access Control to define who can access the Kubernetes API and what actions they are allowed to perform. 
Use strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication and enforce password policies.

## Network Policies
Use network policies to restrict traffic within the cluster and to/from external sources. 
Use firewalls and security groups to control traffic to and from the cluster.

## Encrypt data at rest
Use encryption to protect sensitive data stored in etcd and other components of the cluster.

## Secure Container Images
Use container images from trusted sources and scan them for vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Cluster Monitoring
Use tools like Kubernetes Audit Logs and security monitoring solutions to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

## Upgrades
Keep the Kubernetes cluster and its components up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
